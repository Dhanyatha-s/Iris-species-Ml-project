# Iris flower-species-Ml-project

An Iris flower classification project is a classic example of a machine learning task, often used for beginners to understand the fundamentals of classification algorithms. The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics, introduced by the British biologist and statistician Ronald A. Fisher in 1936. The dataset consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, each belonging to one of three species: setosa, versicolor, or virginica.

Here's an overview of how you might approach an Iris flower classification machine learning project:

Project Overview:
  1. Objective:
    The main goal is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify iris flowers into their respective species based on certain features.
  2. Dataset:
    The Iris dataset consists of four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) and a target variable (species). Each instance in the dataset represents a particular iris flower.
  3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
    Understand the structure of the dataset.
    Check for missing values.
    Visualize the distribution of each feature.
    Explore the relationship between features and the target variable.
  4. Data Preprocessing:
  Handle any missing data.
  Encode categorical variables (if needed).
  Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
  5. Model Selection:
    Support Vector Machines (SVM)
    k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) 
  6. Model Training:
      The training dataset to train the selected model.
  7. Model Evaluation:
    Evaluate the model's performance using the testing dataset.
    Metrics may include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
  8. Hyperparameter Tuning:
      Optimize the model by tuning hyperparameters for better performance.
  9. Deployment (Optional):
      If the model performs well, consider deploying it for real-world use.
  10. Documentation:
      Document the steps, choices, and results of your project for future reference.
  11. Visualization (Optional):
          Visualize the decision boundaries or other relevant aspects of the model.
